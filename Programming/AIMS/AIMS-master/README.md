## Getting Started

Welcome to the AIMS project. Here is a guideline to help you get started.

## Folder Structure

Within the workspace, you'll find the following folders organized as follows:

- `src/main`: This directory holds the main source code files for the project.
- `src/test`: Here lies the folder designated for testing purposes.

This project utilizes Maven as its dependency management tool, allowing for seamless management and integration of dependencies. Feel free to dive in and start exploring or modifying as needed.

*Caution*: Prior to running this program, ensure that SQLite3 is installed on your system. Please double-check to guarantee the smooth execution of the program.
